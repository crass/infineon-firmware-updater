/**
 *	@brief		Processes a sequence of TPM commands to clear the TPM1.2 ownership.
 *	@details	This function removes the TPM owner that was temporarily created during an update from TPM1.2 to TPM1.2.
 *				The function utilizes the MicroTss library.
 *
 *	@param		PpTpmClearOwnership		Pointer to an initialized IfxTpm12ClearOwnership structure to be filled in
 *
 *	@retval		RC_SUCCESS						The operation completed successfully.
 *	@retval		RC_E_BAD_PARAMETER				An invalid parameter was passed to the function. PpTpmClearOwnership was invalid.
 *	@retval		RC_E_NOT_SUPPORTED_FEATURE		In case of the TPM is a TPM2.0
 *	@retval		RC_E_TPM12_NO_OWNER				The TPM1.2 does not have an owner.
 *	@retval		RC_E_NO_IFX_TPM					The underlying TPM is not an Infineon TPM.
 *	@retval		RC_E_UNSUPPORTED_CHIP			In case of the underlying TPM does not support that functionality
 *	@retval		RC_E_TPM12_INVALID_OWNERAUTH	In case of the expected owner authorization can not be verified
 *	@retval		RC_E_FAIL						An unexpected error occurred.
 *	@retval		...								Error codes from called functions.
